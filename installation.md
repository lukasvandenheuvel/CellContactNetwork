## Fiji macros installation

Follow these instructions to install [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) on your computer and activate the [MIST](https://pages.nist.gov/MIST/) update site. This will allow you to stitch a set of tiles generated by the High-Content Analyzer (CX7) into a fused image.  

- Install [Fiji](https://imagej.net/Fiji), if you had not installed it already.
- Make sure that ImageJ is updated to version ```v1.53h``` or higher. To check this, open Fiji and go to ```Help > Update ImageJ```. Press OK if the version number is lower than ```v1.53h```.
- To activate the MIST update site, go to ```Help > Update...``` and click ```Manage update sites```. Here, search for the MIST checkbox, check it, and press ```Close```.
